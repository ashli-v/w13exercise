            <h3>Generative Poem</h3>
            <p id="poemContent">
                In the shadows, it lingers,<br>
                A silent thief of time.<br>
                Dreams deferred, moments slipping away,<br>
                Procrastination takes its toll.<br><br>

                Anxiety whispers softly,<br>
                A constant companion,<br>
                Stress builds, a weight on the chest,<br>
                Holding us in place, unmoving.<br><br>

                Tasks pile up, a mountain to climb,<br>
                The mind races, overwhelmed.<br>
                Yet, in the quiet moments,<br>
                A spark of hope emerges.<br><br>

                Dawn breaks, light filters in,<br>
                New steps are taken, small but sure.<br>
                With each breath, a bit of strength,<br>
                A path forward begins to form.<br><br>

                Potential unfolds, slowly but surely,<br>
                With each new day, we grow.<br>
                Hope guides us, a beacon in the dark,<br>
                Promising new horizons within reach.

            <h3>Generative Short Story - The Bridge at Midnight</h3>
            <p id="storyContent">
                "There is no ghost here, only what we bring with us," I said, though a chill ran down my spine. The room felt heavier than I had expected.<br><br>
                
                Beyond the archway, the masked figure had walked through the rooms unnoticed, a silent testament to the horror that was waiting to unfold.<br><br>
                
                "In a world like this, death is just another appointment," Wehling muttered under his breath, as though the weight of existence had grown too much to bear.<br><br>
                
                "If you can find the hidden will," Poirot reminded himself, "it is yours—but if not, then you leave with nothing."<br><br>
                
                Farquhar, bound and staring down at the swirling river below, felt the rope tighten around his neck, his vision blurring as the soldiers stepped back. He closed his eyes, wondering how it had come to this.<br><br>
                
                The candlelight flickered weakly, barely pushing back the encroaching shadows. Every corner of the room seemed to shift with movement. Was it real, or just fear playing tricks?<br><br>
                
                The painter, lost in thought, whispered to himself, "A clean, orderly world... But at what cost?" He paused, his brush suspended mid-air as though waiting for an answer that would never come.<br><br>
                
                As Farquhar’s mind raced, the roar of rushing water filled his ears, drowning out any hope of clear thought. The world narrowed into that singular, suffocating moment.<br><br>
                
                Poirot’s frustration grew. "This puzzle," he muttered, "is unlike any other I’ve faced. Nothing adds up." His fingers traced the edge of the desk, hoping for a clue.<br><br>
                
                With each stroke of the clock, the once vibrant ballroom seemed to fade, its grand colors replaced by an oppressive darkness that crept in from the edges, closing in on those still dancing. The weight of time pressed down on them all.<br><br>
                
                The air in the room was thick, suffocating, as though every breath brought you closer to the truth you didn’t want to face.<br><br>
                
                Then, with a sharp jerk, Farquhar was suddenly free. The noose snapped, and he was falling—falling into the cold river below. The water engulfed him, the world twisting into a strange, distorted reality.<br><br>
                
                The orderly’s voice echoed, detached and clinical: "We’ve all got our place. Yours just happens to be at the end of a number." The finality of it settled like a stone in the pit of his stomach.<br><br>
                
                Poirot's mind raced. "The study's walls hide more secrets than we can imagine," he thought, certain that there was something crucial just out of sight. “It’s there, Hastings—I know it is.”<br><br>
                
                The final chime of the clock echoed through the halls, sealing the fate of all those who had defied the inevitable. The last breath of the night slipped away, leaving only silence.<br><br>
                
                I stood there, unable to move, as the last remnants of light flickered out. The darkness was absolute.
